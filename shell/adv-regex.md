# Regular Expressions

**Regular Expressions** (also known as a **regexp** or **regex**) are coded
character strings used to match complex patterns in text. Characters in a regex
are either control sequences with special meaning for how a pattern should be
matched or literal characters to be matched. Characters which have special
meaning are referred to as **metacharacters**.
