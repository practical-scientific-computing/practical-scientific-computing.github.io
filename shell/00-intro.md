# Unix Shells

## Linux+GNU or Unix

If you are using a Linux environment as your development computer, setup is essentially done before you even start. You simply need to launch a terminal emulator that is included with your environment and start going through the tutorials.


## OSX 

OSX is actually a fully certified Unix environment that includes many of the tools used in this set of tutorials. There is even a terminal emulator included with the OS, called `Terminal`, that you can use. There is a much more useful terminal emulator available for OSX called `iterm2` that you can also install from [http://iterm2.com/]. If you are using OSX for development and are using the terminal often, it is highly recommended. 

## Windows

The Windows operating system is much more difficult to translate these tutorials into. Windows has an entirely separate history from the Unix side of computing, and all of the internals are incompatible with the Unix philosophy. This can be remedied in a few ways but comes at the cost of maintaining a somewhat unsupported environment.
