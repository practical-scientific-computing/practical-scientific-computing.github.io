# Introduction to Python

Created in 1991 by "benevolent dictator-for-life" Guido van Rossum, Python is a
general-purpose dynamically-typed programming language. Python supports multiple
paradigms including object-oriented, imperative, and procedural styles. Its
hallmarks include great readability, simplicity, and a comprehensive standard
library. 

Python has found widespread use, including in the scientific community.
Python code can be run as interpreted scripts or built into standalone
executables. As such, it is an invaluable tool to any aspiring scientists.
