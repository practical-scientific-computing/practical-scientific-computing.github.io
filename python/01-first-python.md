# My First time opening python

In this interactive terminal, we'll walk through opening Python for the
first time. For simplicity, we'll do this on the command line. First,
find your respective terminal application. After opening, type on the command
line

```
which python
```

This command will let you know which version of python you are running, if any.
If you do not have python installed, take a look at the introduction page.

Next, since python is installed, let's try to open it. Type

```
python
```
You should see something like the following

```
Python 2.7.8 (default, Oct 19 2014, 16:03:53) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.51)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

Great! You've opened python for the first time! Now how the heck do you get
out of it? You can either type "exit()" or use the key command "Ctrl-D" to exit.
