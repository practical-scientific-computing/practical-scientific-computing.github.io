# *Mathematica* Workshop

This workshop aims to show useful parts of the *Mathematica* programming language and how to use the language in your research projects.
We expect attendees will have at least a basic working knowledge of the syntax.
We will start with a quick overview of the basics and work our way towards practical examples and uses of *Mathematica* in scientific research.
